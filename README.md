# Week planner

A small project created to practice for a 48 hour exam in the course PG5100 Enterprise Programmering 1 at HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania og Westerdals. 

It's a simple task planner for the week. You add the tasks you want to complete on a given day and mark them as done when they are completed.

- Spring
- Using JSF for frontend since this course is focusing on the backend.
- Hibernate
- JUnit
- Selenium
- H2 Database
